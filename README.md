## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

A lot about heights, particularly using them to achieve the design responsively. I did not realize you couldn't just set a height to 100% on a media query if none of the parents have a set height.

### Useful resources

In the future, I'll probably have to pay more attention to the resources I use along the way.
